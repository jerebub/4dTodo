# 4dTodo
a todo-app built with flutter that is based on four dimensional time-management

## 4D Time Management
4D Time Management is a time management system that is based on the four dimensions:
- **Urgent**: Tasks that are urgent and need to be done immediately
- **Important**: Tasks that are important and need to be done
- **Unimportant**: Tasks that are not important and can be done later
- **Not Urgent**: Tasks that are not urgent and can be done later

Those dimensions are used in regard to personal priorities and goals, like work, family, hobbies, etc.
Together they form a matrix that helps to prioritize tasks and to manage time more effectively.

This method is also known as the Eisenhower Matrix. It can be critized for being too simplistic as important tasks are rarely urgent and urgent tasks are rarely important. But it is a good starting point for time management and can be adapted to personal needs.
